# nasa-neo-project

Goal: Implement a program that pulls data from the NASA webservice and collect data to be analyzed.

Core questions to answer:
How many potentially hazardous near-earth objects (PHAs) pass near Earth each day in my chosen date range?
What are the top N largest objects that had close approaches in my date range?
Which objects had the smallest miss distance each day/week?

Data collection:
- Daily pulls
- Ability to back fill in case of failure
